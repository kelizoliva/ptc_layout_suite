PTC Layouts adapted from Juiced Up Layouts
-----------------

These set of layouts provide/rely on a lightweight CSS flexbox grid system called JuicedCSS by Joey Lea ( http://juicedcss.com ).
You may read about using this layout system here: http://juicedcss.com/bower_components/juiced/docs/layout.html .
If you are using this layout, you may use these grid classes in your theme's CSS -- .col-3 .col-order-1 etc...

One of the goals of these layouts is to be as semantic HTML and accessible as possible.

These layouts are not for every demographic since they rely on CSS Flexbox -- a newer technology.  Check out which browsers support Flexbox at http://caniuse.com/#search=flexbox .

The layouts contained within this set are:

ptc_full_screen_top -- a full screen content area with the site menu at the top

ptc_full_screen_left -- a full screen content area with the site menu at the left

ptc_full_screen_right -- a full screen content area with the site menu at the right
